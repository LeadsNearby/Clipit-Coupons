## Frequently Asked Questions

Q. How many coupons am I allowed to create for a single domain? 
A. UNLIMITED!!! Create as many as you want. There is no limit.

Q. Do you offer a coupon theme?
A. ClipIt is not meant to compete with, or replace software, scripts or websites intended for 100% coupon based websites. There are some great scripts out there, if you are looking to create a coupon site such as RetailMeNot.com, Coupons.com, etc.

ClipIt is meant to be an add on for blogs or websites that reference a special deal or coupon in its posts- as a supplement to an existing or new content or review based blog.
